# Milestone 5: Final Deliverables

Your final deliverable for this project will include three components.

### System Code: 
Push your group's code to this repository, including a README with (1) a link to the hosted system, and (2) instructions to run the system locally. To host the system, Github pages should be sufficient if all you need is a static site (i.e., no database or server-side code). 

### Document:
Your group should also include a short 2-3 page document that includes the following items in PDF format: 
- summary of dataset characteristics, 
- image(s) of your interface, captioned or annotated to describe the visual representation and interaction design,
- group member contributions. Who did what? This can be in the form of a table or a short bulleted list, and
- reflections. Did the implementation go according to plan? Did you hit any substantial roadblocks? Did the design diverge at some point from earlier design intentions? Did the team work well together?

### Video Figure: 
Videos should be 2-4 minutes long. Production quality is secondary -- instead, the goal is to demonstrate how your visualization works. This video should show (and narrate) how to interact with your visualization. Consider doing so in the form of a short usage scenario. Consider using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/movie-maker-10-free/9mvfq4lmz6c9?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Microsoft Movie Maker</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/">Apple iMovie</a> to edit your videos, or just capture a narrated screen recording using software such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL837?locale=en_US">QuickTime</a> or similar. 

In class, each group's video will be shared. A portion of your grade for this milestone will be based on peer feedback. Watch your classmates' videos carefully and provide helpful critique.
